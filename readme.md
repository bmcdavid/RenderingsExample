# Renderings Example

This project is an example site for [Renderings.UmbracoCms](https://github.com/bmcdavid/Renderings) using the [Umbraco Starter Kit](https://our.umbraco.org/projects/starter-kits/the-starter-kit/) to demonstrate how to build rich view models for displaying CMS content.

Renderings will not create models from code, but rather create a friendly way to build razor views with classes using dependency injection (DI).

The database is included and can be login using:
